So instead, I'm going to sing an old Neapolitan ballad. It's a song about lost love. Sotto la gr\u00f3nda della torre antica, una r\u00f3ndine amica a lo sbocciar del almondo or lui tornata. Ritorni tutti l'anni sempre alla stessa data, monti e mari sa varca per tornar. Solo amore quando fugenda lontana sper invano, ma non torni piu. Sper invano ma non torna piu."
