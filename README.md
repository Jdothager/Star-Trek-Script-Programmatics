# Star-Trek-Script-Programmatics

A bit of a messy repo from my work but better the data be out there than not.

`dumps to plaintext for training` are various iterations of dumps from `script_mechanic.py`, a tiny very stupid system for dumping and searching scripts.

`processed` contains TNG and VOY scripts in cleaned JSON mode.

Fair warning, these scripts have typos due to conversion problems and the code to generate and wrangle them is poorly written and hastily slapped together -- please temper expectations (and know that I can code better than this when I want to).
